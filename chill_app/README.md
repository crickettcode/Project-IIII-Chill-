# Project IIII/Chill


> Project Chill is an application that was intended to be a stress tracker. The app has three models which include: the user, journal entries, and check-ins'. The user is able to "check in" throughout the day and record their stress level by entering in a score within a range of (1-10). One being best and 10 being worst. The areas include factors such as "hunger", "gratitude", "motivation", and so forth. The API "re-charts" would then be used to graph their stress levels over a specified amount of time. There is also a place for the user to enter a journal entry in paragraph form to summarize their emotions throughout the day. The API Watson would then be used to analyze the users' overall emotional health over the same time period. At the end of the week, the user would then have two forms of data to determine their overall emotional health and stress level. These two methods of collection would then allow for comparing and contrasting the user's idea of how they "thought they felt" against the AI's synopsis of the data analyzed. I thought that this would be an interesting and different angle on improving emotional well being and promoting better habits to manage stress levels. I also included the XKCD API to generate random comics and keep things fun and light.

## Technologies Used 

The technologies that we used were:

* _Ruby on Rails_ for the backend 
* _React_ for the frontend 
* _Semantic UI_for styled components
* _Trello_ for task organization 
* _Heroku_ for web hosting our project

## Takeaways 
 
 > For me, the last project was actually the most difficult.  I think that I put more pressure on myself than was necessary because I wanted it to be the very best project I'd ever done. In the end, I believe it was that, just in a different way than I had planned. This project may not look outstanding and it's certainly not what I had imagined my final project would be when I first began this course, but honestly, it is still MY best project. It is the culmination of three months of extremely hard work, committment, and dedication. I pushed myself farther than I ever thought I could, and I didn't quit. I love Web development more than I ever have and cannot wait to follow my career path with a whole hearted fervor. I now know that I can grow and learn and be uncomfortable and not only survive the experience but thrive in the process. <br/>
 > My favorite part of this project was pulling in the API and realizing the freedom I have found in creating the things that I enjoy and the opportunity to problem solve and take my dreams and the dreams of others' and create a reality. The other big takeaway from this project was the commradory I found in my classmates and fellow coding community. I spent the last weekend of the project at a former GA student's house with a few other classmates and we bonded over the final project and supporting eachother through the end of the beginning of our shared journey into the tech field. 
 > The most difficult part of this project was completing all of my plans for the application. I will be spending the next two weeks refactoring and implenting the remaining API's to create the full user experience that I originally desired. 

 
### Skills Aquired

+ The strength found in connecting with classmates and the tech community 
+ Understanding Frustration leads to solving problems
+ Gratitude and a positive attitude
+ Time management


### Mostly, I learned that this course was everything I'd hoped for, and then some :)
