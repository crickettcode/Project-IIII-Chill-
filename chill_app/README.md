# Project IIII/Chill


> Project Chill is an application that was intended to be a stress tracker. The app has three models which include: the user, journal entries, and check-ins'. The user is able to "check in" throughout the day and record their stress level by entering in a score within a range of (1-10). One being best and 10 being worst. The areas include factors such as "hunger", "gratitude", "motivation", and so forth. The API "re-charts" would then be used to graph their stress levels over a specified amount of time. There is also a place for the user to enter a journal entry in paragraph form to summarize their emotions throughout the day. The API Watson would then be used to analyze the users' overall emotional health over the same time period. At the end of the week, the user would then have two forms of data to determine their overall emotional health and stress level. These two methods of collection would then allow for comparing and contrasting the user's idea of how they "thought they felt" against the AI's synopsis of the data analyzed. I thought that this would be an interesting and different angle on improving emotional well being and promoting better habits to manage stress levels. I also included the XKCD API to generate random comics and keep things fun and light.

## Takeaways 
 
 > For starters, I think that the group project was slightly more difficult than we initially anticipated. However, while we struggled in many areas, we gained valuable experience and discovered strengths in others. I think from the beginning that we started off as a team wih a good sense of commradery. Early on in the project we spent an entire weekend day at a team member's home and grilled out while we programmed. I think that behaviors' such as this have valuable real world application when it comes to team morale and communication. We mobbed programmed that day and continued with this style for the remainder of the project. Each day we spent our lunches' together and made an effort to keep up with our enthusiasm. 
 > Some of the weaknesses that we discovered as a team were difficulty with delegating tasks. It would have been to our advantage to mob program in the beginning of the project and to seperate the tasks further into the project in order to get more accomplished. I think that we struggled with this due to time constraints as well as the novelty of a "group project" to each of us individually. 
 > Throughout everything I do believe that this was a positive experience for the group as a whole.
